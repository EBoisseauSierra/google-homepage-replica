# Google homepage replica

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum ([chapter 1.3.4](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)). It is a simple replica of Google homepage to practice basic HTML and CSS.

I've used a grid template, and tried to streamline the code as possible. Improvement would include a responsive design and refactoring CSS using best practices.

The result can be seen [here](https://etiennebosi.github.io/google-homepage-replica/).
